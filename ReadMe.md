### i. Branching

#### General
Observe the following in order to have your PR merged successfully.
- Create **branches from the `dev` branch** of your forked repo.
- Create a **PR to the `dev` branch**
- Prefix **branch name** with its **issue label then issue number** of the most significant issue being solved ie `bug/21`, `ui/23`, `enhancement/45`. This means you need to have an issue open before you can work on a contribution. Where an issue has several labels, choose branch name in order of precedence, `enhancement > bug > ui > testing > documentation`.
- Fix the least number of issues per PR. Best, **1 issue per PR**. Else, tag any other issue solved in the PR.

#### Branch Naming Format
`<issue type>/<issue number>`
